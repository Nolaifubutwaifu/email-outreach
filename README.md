# Photography Outreach Manager

> **Sending account:** every email from this project is always sent from
> **maximilianumschaden@gmail.com**. That is the only account this toolkit uses —
> the Gmail credentials, drafts, and sent mail all belong to it. No other address
> is involved in this project.

A small local web app for sending free-shoot outreach to local businesses from your
Gmail account (**maximilianumschaden@gmail.com**). Find businesses by area,
auto-scrape their public email + Instagram + Facebook, review the list, and create a
**Gmail draft** (or send directly) for each — with built-in tracking of who you've
already contacted.

## Setup (one-time, ≈20–30 min)

### 1. Install Python deps
From this folder:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Enable the Gmail API and get credentials
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create a project (any name).
2. In the search bar, open **Gmail API** and click **Enable**.
3. Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**. Choose **External**, fill in
   the app name and use **maximilianumschaden@gmail.com**, and add that same
   address as a **Test user**. (Keep it in "Testing" mode — no Google review
   needed for personal use.) Always authorise as
   **maximilianumschaden@gmail.com** when the browser opens on first run — that is
   the account mail is sent from.
4. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID**.
   Choose **Desktop app**. Download the JSON.
5. Rename that file to **`credentials.json`** and put it in this folder.

> `credentials.json` and the `token.json` created on first run are secrets.
> They're in `.gitignore` — never commit them.

## Run it
```bash
.venv/bin/python app.py
```
Then open **http://127.0.0.1:5050** (set `PORT=8000` etc. to change the port).

The first time you create a draft or send, a browser opens to authorise Gmail. The
email wording lives in `email_template.txt` and is editable right in the app.

## What it does
- **Find businesses** — enter a category + area (e.g. *cafe* in *Saint Lucia,
  Brisbane*); it pulls businesses and their websites from Google Places, then scrapes
  each site for the email + socials. *(Optional — needs a Places API key, see below.)*
- **From websites** — paste a batch of site links (one per line) and scrape those.
- **Bulk paste / Single** — add contacts from `Name, email` lines or one at a time.
- **Create draft or send** — one click puts a ready-to-send email in your **Gmail
  Drafts** to review. Flip the **Draft / Send** toggle to email immediately instead
  (drafts are the default and safer). Works per-business or for the whole "to send"
  list at once.
- **Tracking** — everything is saved to `contacts.csv` with a status
  (*To send / Drafted / Sent / Replied*) and the time each was contacted. Re-adding
  the same email is skipped, so your list never doubles up.

> The free scraper reads each site's own pages for a published email and social
> links. Some businesses hide their email behind a contact form — for those, just
> type the address into the review row before adding.

### Find businesses with Google Places (optional)

The **Find businesses** tab needs a Google Maps Platform API key. One-time setup:

1. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (same project as
   your Gmail credentials), open **APIs & Services → Library**, search
   **Places API (New)**, and **Enable** it.
2. Turn on **billing**: **Billing → link a billing account** (add a card). Required
   even though normal personal use stays inside Google's free monthly tier.
3. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → API key.** Copy the key.
   (Recommended: edit the key → **Restrict key → Places API (New)**.)
4. Paste the key into a file called **`places_api_key.txt`** in this folder
   (it's gitignored), or set the `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable.

Then restart the app. Google Places only returns name/website/phone/address — the
email always comes from scraping the business's own site, so leads with no website
(or no published email) will need the address typed in by hand.

## A note on the law (you're in Australia)
The Spam Act 2003 applies to commercial emails. Only email businesses whose contact
address is **publicly listed**, keep volumes modest, and honour any "unsubscribe"
reply immediately. This isn't legal advice — when in doubt, check the ACMA guidance
on commercial electronic messages.
